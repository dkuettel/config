general:
    - made mess when trying to show [2]= for tiled
        - also my bug or is there not a layout per desktop? ah no wait, per monitor, but there is only one monitor
        - their code already dirtily does it on the fly for [M] and ignores user settings
    - some problem when unsleeping with ata8.00 (main disk)
    - dbus works and stuff, but need to make .xsession so all default stuff gets done
        - just play around with lsvm or so, install a normal ubuntu, compare setting, env, services, ...
        - can even run one in vbox? shared lsvm and vbox?
        - snapshotting lsvm for trying out and when nice do again with a clean script?
    - no or longer monitor-off timeout
    - control dell monitor profiles?
    - do I have a 32 or 64 bit installation?
        /usr/lib has no x86_64
    - dual hibernate with windows?
        - some solutions that vetter mentioned? share vbox or so with an acutal disk?
    - transmission service off by default?
    - could dwm replace itself with a replace-exec call on its newly compiled binary?
        - or do we need to shutdown cleanly and then do it? as with exitcode?
    - for the stacked small windows it would be awesome to scale them instead of resize and reflow, especially on a 4k monitor
    - maybe the stick mount thing in fstab is not good? it seems like it keeps on retrying?
    - can do key sequences instead of single shortcuts in dwm?


bootstrap by getting a clone or copy of this into ~/config

mostly tested on
    ubuntu 18.04 mini with 'opensshserver' + 'basic ubuntu server'
    ubuntu 18.04 desktop


todos:
    - save pictures of how colors.py output should look
        maybe on different terminals
        for easy checking if things are right
        especially how can I quickly check if bright/bold changes color or just font
        if I have 8 or 16 colors
        if tmux translates colors or not
        if tmux #[fg=...] does the right thing
        why I cannot use color00 in fg= in tmux?
        if true color works

    - would it make sense to have a terminfo tmux-16color so no client is tempted to use more?
        or just completely move to truecolor?

    - try pane titles with info and for easy spotting of active window?
        pane titles include pane index
        could easily switch then
        prefix-# for windows
        prefix-shift+# for panes or something like that?
        or alt-#?
        or just another prefix (multi stroke is easier)

    - add st config and compilation stuff
    - check in /root for nvidia setup (ptc desktop)

    - could be interesting with tmux?
        http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Modules.html#The-zsh_002fclone-Module

    - add powerline fonts or remove them form vim config as well

    - snaps now put their config files in ~/snap, so spotify could maybe be configured automatically?

    - my mouse is too slow
        how to configure independent of guis? and align it with my windows10?

    - originally the folder in the prompt was yellow or green or so, maybe a bit nicer than now

    - how/where to apt install what we need for eg in config/bin? (eg ctags)
        one nice way is to maybe just do it in that file? first time you have to sudo? or maybe not so nice

    - vim (at least in python) tries to be too smart again
        - indent +1 when it thinks it should
        - import from pops up stuff

    - the .. command doesn't work correctly for example in a folder ~/trains/trains, it will stay in the same folder
