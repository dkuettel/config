bootstrap by getting a clone or copy of this into ~/config

based on an ubuntu 18.04 server installation
# todo try ubuntu minimal
# todo normal ubuntu (non-server) has less things installed (?)

save pictures of how colors.py output should look
maybe on different terminals
for easy checking if things are right

especially how can I quickly check if bright/bold changes color or just font
if I have 8 or 16 colors
if tmux translates colors or not
if tmux #[fg=...] does the right thing
why I cannot use color00 in fg= in tmux?
if true color works

would it make sense to have a terminfo tmux-16color so no client is tempted to use more?
or just completely move to truecolor?

try pane titles with info and for easy spotting of active window?
pane titles include pane index
could easily switch then
prefix-# for windows
prefix-shift+# for panes or something like that?
or alt-#?
or just another prefix (multi stroke is easier)

todo: add st config and compilation stuff
todo: check in /root for nvidia setup

could be interesting with tmux?
