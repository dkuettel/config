bootstrap by getting a clone or copy of this into ~/config

mostly tested on
	ubuntu 18.04 mini with 'opensshserver' + 'basic ubuntu server'
	ubuntu 18.04 desktop


todos:
	- save pictures of how colors.py output should look
		maybe on different terminals
		for easy checking if things are right
		especially how can I quickly check if bright/bold changes color or just font
		if I have 8 or 16 colors
		if tmux translates colors or not
		if tmux #[fg=...] does the right thing
		why I cannot use color00 in fg= in tmux?
		if true color works

	- would it make sense to have a terminfo tmux-16color so no client is tempted to use more?
		or just completely move to truecolor?

	- try pane titles with info and for easy spotting of active window?
		pane titles include pane index
		could easily switch then
		prefix-# for windows
		prefix-shift+# for panes or something like that?
		or alt-#?
		or just another prefix (multi stroke is easier)

	- add st config and compilation stuff
	- check in /root for nvidia setup (ptc desktop)

	- could be interesting with tmux?

	- add powerline fonts or remove them form vim config as well

	- snaps now put their config files in ~/snap, so spotify could maybe be configured automatically?

	- my mouse is too slow
		how to configure independent of guis? and align it with my windows10?

	- originally the folder in the prompt was yellow or green or so, maybe a bit nicer than now
