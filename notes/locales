> sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
to install locales, all is an option, not too much disk space really
but can take a while, so being specific is useful
check man page, maybe that can be done with arguments and non-interactive
in server setup, not just desktop

by default on ubuntu server 20.04 seems like LC_ALL is set
but documentation says that's a bad idea
instead LANG should be set
and then LC_* for specific overwrites if necessary

I'm not sure if it should be set in your shell init
that's executed everytime
maybe something about the "profile" init file? that's not executed everytime?
check zsh probably

also, does for example ls respect LC for showing nice dates?
