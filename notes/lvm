man lvm is a good overview

is an easier shell without needing sudo everytime

but I still dont know of an easy way to get an overview of the "topology"

helps (from me)

filters in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf can prevent
"/dev/sde no medium found"-like warnings
eg, use filter = [ "r|/dev/sde|" ] to ignore that device

resize, especially shrink
> lvresize --resizefs --size 100G /dev/vg/vg_data
but needs to be unmounted?

snapshot
> lvcreate --snapshot --name snap --size 200g vg/u2204server /dev/sdb
recover into origin
> lvconvert --mergesnapshot vg/snap
often needs update-grub because it might be a different kernel now
