man lvm is a good overview
> sudo lvm
is an easier shell without needing sudo everytime
> partitionmanager supports parts of lvm
but I still dont know of an easy way to get an overview of the "topology"
> lvm-overview
helps (from me)

filters in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf can prevent
"/dev/sde no medium found"-like warnings
eg, use filter = [ "r|/dev/sde|" ] to ignore that device

resize, especially shrink
> lvresize --resizefs --size 100G /dev/vg/vg_data
but needs to be unmounted?
