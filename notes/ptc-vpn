original documentation https://ptccloud.sharepoint.com/:f:/t/IT-DTT-Team/EmJWI6-v6iRPgA_eDo0kp8ABlOO4CerPB41L-ft7Vc7Z-w?e=DVfivc
has some mistakes

use kvm, works nicely (virtualbox is more hassle)
virt-manager for gui
install from provided ptc iso image
if possible during install, set username, and mostly set hostname to something like dkuettel1vx1 or x2, or x3, ...

default password is ptccde4, change it after login
use hostnamectl to set hostname as above

install all updates
some will fail, winbind, can probably be removed

this might not really be necessary ...
systemctl start salt-minion
systemctl enable salt-minion
systemctl status cylancesvc.service, probably shows errors, should be fine

launch /usr/local/pulse/pulseUI
use emea-portal.ptc.com for vpn url, not as in documentation
login

use firefox for oracle and stuff
probably finprdapp.ptc.com:5092/OA_HTML/OA.jsp?OAFunc=OAHOMEPAGE
(not sure if there is a better url)
