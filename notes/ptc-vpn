password was ptccde4, change it
somehow user doesnt change even if set at install time
works when installed in vbox more or less
set user to dkuettel1vx1 or 2 and so on, then no need to change it later
(do it in the setup)
kvm works nicely actually

after complete update graphics not messed up anymore
but some updates failed windind or samba or something
maybe only working inside ptc? samba connection might be nice

updating trying
but saltsack has some problems, about i386 arch or so
