on linux:
    /var/lib/bluetooth contains the receivers and devices
    /var/lib/bluetooth/[receiver-mac]/[device-mac]/info contains connection infos
        [LinkKey] Key=... is the private key for the connection
    'sudo hcitool dev' also shows the mac addresses for all bluetooth receivers
    also check what you call your linux machine (hostname), as thats the name it shows when connecting via bluetooth

on windows:
    learned from https://github.com/LondonAppDev/dual-boot-bluetooth-pair
    view HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\BTHPORT\Parameters\Keys in regedit
    note you need to run regedit in privileged mode, "as admin" doesnt seem to work
    I needed to use psexec (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec), no built-in way to do that?!
    it contains the key in a similar fashion as linux
    in the device manager best change the bluetooth receiver's name to what it is in linux
    before you connect a device, so the names don't conflict
    .\PsExec.exe -i -d -s c:\windows\regedit.exe
    in command (run as admin)
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\BTHPORT\Parameters\Keys
    really no easy way to run elevated ... crazy windows :0

the main idea is to make both systems use the same link key
one approach is:
    first the device is not paired at all
    in linux pair like normal
    in windows pair like normal again (making the device forget the pairing with linux)
    in windows get the link key
    in linux overwrite the link key
    restart bluetooth 'sudo systemctl restart bluetooth'
    (it's probably a good idea to not make the device connect to linux before you have updated this)
