sometimes it wakes up for no reason
even from poweroff state
is that from random wake-up packets?

but more importantly maybe, the wakups from sleep or hibernate
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnderstandingSuspend has some info
still disabling all in /proc/acpi/wakeup I can use the usb keyboard to wakeup?!

> tailf /var/log/syslog | less
I dont find a mention of what deviced cause the restart
not even the keyboard (when wanted) I see it mentioned
