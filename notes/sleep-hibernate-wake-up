sometimes it wakes up for no reason
even from poweroff state
is that from random wake-up packets?

but more importantly maybe, the wakups from sleep or hibernate
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UnderstandingSuspend has some info
still disabling all in /proc/acpi/wakeup I can use the usb keyboard to wakeup?!

> tailf /var/log/syslog | less
I dont find a mention of what deviced cause the restart
not even the keyboard (when wanted) I see it mentioned

then there is
> ls sys/**/wakeup
expecially
> ls sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/wakeup
that contains enabled or disabled
seems to contain more elements than /proc/acpi/wakeup
and you can echo 'enabled' or 'disabled' into it
but it looks like all links to /sys/devices, maybe that's the easiest to look at
at least that could explain why some stuff still makes it wake up
even though I disabled everything in /proc/acpi/wakeup
but for now /proc/acpi/wakeup solves my problem, let's see if that is true, random boots are very seldom anyway

currently trying the approach as in i/wakeup
