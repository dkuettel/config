by default I had it in /swap.img, from a more or less default ubuntu 20.04 server installation
as defined in /etc/fstab

usually not really needed so much anymore, could be none
but for hibernate you need it, and should be large enough (?)
I guess then it can be on a slower disk, not so important

I dont think there is a way to make it "lazy" so it only uses the spaces when it actually does
(lvm-based, but maybe not worth the hassle)

commands to hot enable and disable
> swapoff, mkswap, swapon
> blkid /dev/sdb2 to get the uuid in fstab UUID= or swapon -U or so
> blkid seems to give me different ones vs lsblk -f, but only at first, later it matched again ...
but eventually needs to be in /etc/stab, something like
> UUID=781957f6-85cc-4099-857f-eb4a1e3e69c5 none swap sw 0 0

looking around on the web, quite mixed info
    for hibernate grub or kernel start call has to know about the swap file?
    or the "resume-from" file?
    see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate

    If you want to use your swap for hibernating then you need to update the UUID in
    /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume with this content RESUME=UUID=xxx.
    Don't forget to > sudo update-initramfs -u.
    above didnt work for me
    see https://askubuntu.com/questions/6769/hibernate-and-resume-from-a-swap-file/1132154#1132154
    really need to do that manually?

did both changes now
    in /etc/default/grub
    > GRUB_CMD_LINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=UUID=...."
    & sudo update-grub
    and in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
    > RESUME=UUID=...
    & update-initramfs -u -k all
    a bit weird, should that really not be default then?
    not sure if both are needed
    but then it works
    it also talks about swap-offset and changing the service files, but that seems to be old?

still the machines starts right away, my problem?
or change service files?

could also test things inside multipass to understand what was really needed?
(make sure to use 20.04, not 21.04 or something)
plus if that one also restarts instead of stays down? probably not an issue there ...
