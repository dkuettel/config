save pictures of how colors.py output should look
maybe on different terminals
for easy checking if things are right

especially how can I quickly check if bright/bold changes color or just font
if I have 8 or 16 colors
if tmux translates colors or not
if tmux #[fg=...] does the right thing
why I cannot use color00 in fg= in tmux?
if true color works

try pane titles with info and for easy spotting of active window?
pane titles include pane index
could easily switch then
prefix-# for windows
prefix-shift+# for panes or something like that?
or alt-#?
or just another prefix (multi stroke is easier)
