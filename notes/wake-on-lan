enable in bios
but also the os must shutdown in a way that the network card stays in standby mode
on ubuntu: sudo ethtool -s INTERFACE wol g
in windows probably needed too

netplan can configure it permanently
seems like the right solution
but someone I need to configure match: macaddress like so:
    network:
      ethernets:
        enp5s0:
          match:
            macaddress: 04:d9:f5:d3:63:ff
          dhcp4: true
          wakeonlan: true
      version: 2
(in /etc/netplan/*)
not sure if it didnt find enp5s0 or if it needs mac address to enable it
netplan has no debuging capabilities to speak of

fritzbox allows to start on demand
it also allows to start on external connection (maybe on port 22)

python to produce a magic packet:
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import socket
    import sys

    broadcast = "192.168.178.255"
    mac = "04:D9:F5:D3:63:FF"

    data = ''.join(['FF' * 6, mac.replace(':', '') * 16])
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)
    sock.sendto(data.decode("hex"), (broadcast, 9))
