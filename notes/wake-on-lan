enable in bios
but also the os must shutdown in a way that the network card stays in standby mode

on ubuntu
    sudo ethtool -s INTERFACE wol g
    (use, eg, ethtool enp5s0 to see current settings)
    for permanent setting see further down
    see https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-enable-wake-on-lan-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/
    see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WakeOnLan

in windows
    in device manager/network cards, set in power management and advanced tab
    see https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-wake-on-lan-windows-10/

ubuntu permanent setting
netplan can configure it permanently
seems like the right solution
but someone I need to configure match: macaddress like so:
    network:
      ethernets:
        enp5s0:
          match:
            macaddress: 04:d9:f5:d3:63:ff
          dhcp4: true
          wakeonlan: true
      version: 2
(in /etc/netplan/*)
not sure if it didnt find enp5s0 or if it needs mac address to enable it
netplan has no debuging capabilities to speak of

fritzbox allows to start on demand
it also allows to start on external connection (maybe on port 22)

python to produce a magic packet:
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import socket
    import sys

    broadcast = "192.168.178.255"
    mac = "04:D9:F5:D3:63:FF"

    data = ''.join(['FF' * 6, mac.replace(':', '') * 16])
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1)
    sock.sendto(data.decode("hex"), (broadcast, 9))
