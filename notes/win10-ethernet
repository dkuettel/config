win10 with powermanagement for ethernet might put it in a state that linux doesn't manage well
switch off powermanagement for ethernet in win10 for convenience

alternatively, reset in linux
find device number with lspci
find /sys -name '*00:19.0'
the one of those, not sure which one worked
    echo 1 >/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:19.0/reset
    echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:19.0/reset
