to have it wait for selection
    GRUB_TIMEOUT=-1
    GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=-1
second one is when it didnt record success in the last boot
but somehow with LVM boot partitions, it doesn't manage to remember that it was successful
so with LVM the normal timeout never applies


to add some shortcuts after the fact, try a file /etc/grub.d/50_shortcuts with something like
    awk '/gnulinux-simple-1c55bc5a-9c45-4474-bf55-033e1f8a7b72/,/}$/ { gsub("{", "--hotkey u {"); print $0 }' /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new
    awk '/osprober-efi-1609-D776/,/}$/ { gsub("{", "--hotkey w {"); print $0 }' /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new


update-grub should discover all relevant entries (win10), but alternatively:
https://ihaveabackup.net/article/grub2-entry-for-windows-10-uefi
add something like
    menuentry 'Windows 10' {
        search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root D464-A236
        chainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
    }
to /etc/grub.d/40_custom
using the uuid from blkid from the right partition
(probably called "EFI system partition")
update-grub after that
