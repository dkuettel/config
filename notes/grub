resolutions:
- go to console with 'c'
- videoinfo shows available modes
- switch resolution interactively: terminal_output console; set gfxterm=wxh; terminal_output gfxterm
    - super slow in any gfx mode, except maybe 640x480 or so
- using video=efifb:3840x2160 works for console
    - needs to be added do the postfix thing: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT

to have it wait for selection (in /etc/default/grub)
    GRUB_TIMEOUT=-1
    GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT=-1
second one is when it didnt record success in the last boot
but somehow with LVM boot partitions, it doesn't manage to remember that it was successful
so with LVM the normal timeout never applies
(update-grub if you made changes)


to add some shortcuts after the fact, try a file /etc/grub.d/50_shortcuts with something like
    awk '/gnulinux-simple-1c55bc5a-9c45-4474-bf55-033e1f8a7b72/,/}$/ { gsub("{", "--hotkey u {"); print $0 }' /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new
    awk '/osprober-efi-1609-D776/,/}$/ { gsub("{", "--hotkey w {"); print $0 }' /boot/grub/grub.cfg.new


update-grub should discover all relevant entries (win10), but alternatively:
https://ihaveabackup.net/article/grub2-entry-for-windows-10-uefi
add something like
    menuentry 'Windows 10' {
        search --fs-uuid --no-floppy --set=root D464-A236
        chainloader (${root})/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
    }
to /etc/grub.d/40_custom
using the uuid from blkid from the right partition
(probably called "EFI system partition")
update-grub after that

booth from an iso, this works
but I think the linux ... line depends on what type of linux you want to boot
(note, iso can be mounted like normal to inspect)
    menuentry "server iso" {
       set isofile="/home/dkuettel/Downloads/ubuntu-22.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso"
       loopback loop (lvm/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv)$isofile
       linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=$isofile noprompt noeject
       initrd (loop)/casper/initrd
    }
could make a dedicated iso folder and automatically scan and add in update-grup?


see also ./swap
in /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=/dev/ubuntu-vg/swap"
seems to control that for all? ok we only need one swap, maybe okay
needed for hibernation resume I think
but how did it get there, since we did it from the newly installed ubuntu before?
or maybe update-grub is not enough after this change?
"After finishing your edits, run sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg (substitute grub.cfg with whatever file grub reads at boot, e.g. it may be named /boot/grub/grub.efi) to update your grub startup information with what you changed in /etc/default/grub" ?
