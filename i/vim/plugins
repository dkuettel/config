# NOTE treesitter installs take long, some might fail with "xyz not a gzip"
# this is because gitlab or others could be in maintenance or down
# but nvim-treesitter just downloads whatever it gets, even the error page
# and then tar complains that it's not gzip data
# I dont have a good way to work around that, it will fail
# would be nice if we could install that stuff outside vim anyway
# also 'TSInstallSync!' forces reinstall, but in turn doesnt ask yes/no questions, so it might be more scripty?
# TODO would be nice if we somehow at least before the below make a check if gitlab or others are down to make the error less cryptic
# see https://status.gitlab.com/
nvim -l plugins.lua

# TODO :checkhealth with grep on error or warnings?
# not sure how to make it unattended :/
