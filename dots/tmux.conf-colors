# in terms of tmux's "color translation" I think 256 colors
# is the same as 16 or 8 for the first few color codes
# so I should get the solarized colors without approximation
# but I think it's a problem that programs might think we support
# 256 colors and then it tries to use all instead of the first 16
# which are optimized, plus changed, so maybe not what was intended
# also current I login using xterm-16color so tmux maps 256 down
# to the 16 colors
# change to xterm-256 colors? a bit more stable
# but best would be a tmux-16color really, so programs use only 16 colors
# see klutzy in https://github.com/altercation/solarized/issues/159
# 256 color also means 16 or 8 color I think (just color integers)
# not sure what it means when I changed the first 16 colors for
# maybe indeed make my own tmux-16color, or just go for true color
set-option -g default-terminal tmux-256color
#set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc" # explicitely say true color is enabled

# todo could maybe have inactive windows a bit dimmed? probably that will only work nicely with true color and some flexible color translation?
#set-option -g window-style 'bg=0'
#set-option -g window-active-style 'bg=8'
