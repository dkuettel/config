# TODO would be nice to easily switch between TUI and GUI
# both dont work well, because smallest client determines size
# can we connect and disconnect on the fly?
# nvim on master supports TUI as client
# neovide also soon(?) supports sockets instead of TCP

# TODO sometimes it doesnt use the right size, because of multigrid?

# TODO a simple thing could be
# in normal vim, a way to start neovide with blocking
# first save session, pass to neovide, neovide saves on exit, and we reload
# plus TUI should :e to be sure all changes are loaded?
# two things are bad:
# - a full new instance needs to run another pyright
# - by default this tiles the window, should we make it floating "fullish" by default?
# best would be if it could be connected to the same current nvim
# but somehow in a passive way so that only on GUI is active and we dont have the "smaller window" problem
# ah or maybe instead can we fake the terminal to be huge while in neovide mode?
# tried it:
# - almost works, --multigrid makes it buggy for some floating stuff, when TUI & GUI
# - but the large terminal otherwise works
# can we make tmux fake a large terminal?
# nvim with TUI is not yet ready, but slated for 0.9 or so
