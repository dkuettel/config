# TODO would be nice to easily switch between TUI and GUI
# both dont work well, because smallest client determines size
# can we connect and disconnect on the fly?
# nvim on master supports TUI as client
# neovide also soon(?) supports sockets instead of TCP

# TODO sometimes it doesnt use the right size, because of multigrid?

neovide --multigrid
