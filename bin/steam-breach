#!/bin/zsh
set -eux -o pipefail

# this works nicely, but doesnt seem to track playing time
# and achievements might only come (if at all) next time you start steam
#cd ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/'Into the Breach'
#./Breach

# the app id you can find from, eg, the app url on the steam website
steam steam://run/590380

# note:
# this starts steam (in the background), if it's not already started
# if it was started already, it will return (on game exit, or immediately, didnt test)
# if it wasn't, it wont return until you exit steam by 'steam' and then exit, so far
# convenient, but also a bit annoying
# 'pgrep steam' is easy to check if it is running in the backgrounds
