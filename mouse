xset m does not have an effect anymore
it's using libinput

> xinput --list-props

at home I had originally
> xinput --set-prop 8 'libinput Accel Speed' 0
and switched it now to 0.5

compare at work

libinput is using dpi, and it gets it from evdev
maybe at home it's a differnent dpi than at work?
at home xdpyinfo reports (not sure if that's what libinput uses)
  dimensions:    3840x2160 pixels (613x352 millimeters)
  resolution:    159x156 dots per inch

not sure how to make the setting persistent
would be nice to do it in the .xsession
but how to get the right id for the mouse?
